     <h1> DIY Mind Machine Custom Headset </h1>
     <div id="myParagraph">
	<p> Laying on a bed in a dark room, and using a gooseneck phone holder is the best way to use the DIY Mind Machine. This setup avoids having anything touching your face, which can be distracting. You can buy gooseneck phone holders on Amazon or Temu. The cheap $6 holders that are sold on Temu work great. However, if you don't have access to a dark room, then a headset is fine too. Virtual reality headsets are ok, but this custom headset is a little more comfortable than the virtual reality headsets I tested: </p>
	   <ul>
       <p> </p>
       <br>
       <li> The custom headset is 3D printed

           <li> <img src="headsetAdditionalView2p0.png" alt="" class="mainImageFormat"/> </li>
          <li> Find someone who can 3D print these custom parts for the main body and front plates.

          <li> Purchase the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B6CLQJCH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Elastic Bands for Wigs</a>  and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JW16JC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Foam Face Replacement Face Cover Pad</a> </li>
          <li> Purchase six #4-40 x 1" pan head machine screws, and six nuts </li>
          <li> Purchase 3/4" wide velcro strips. You will only need to use the "hook" or "prickly" side of the velcro. </li>
          <li> Follow the assembly instructions below. </li>

       </ul>

        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li> Cut each strap in half. Feed the straps through the slots. Use the front slot for your phone, back slot for your head. </li>
          <li> Secure the two most outer plates with the two machine screws and nuts that protrude outward, as shown in the picture above.
            <br>These screws will support the phone, along with the velcro straps.</li>
          <li> Secure all of the plates to the main body using the remaining machine screws and nuts.</li>
          <li> Cut some 3/4" wide velcro strips ("hook" or "prickly" side) so that the velcro fits on the top and bottom rim of the main body. </li>
          <li> Attach the face cover pad to the rim of the main body. The face cover pad will stick to the velcro. </li>
          <li> Adjust the straps if necessary. Trim the excess strap once you are satisfied with the fit. </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
