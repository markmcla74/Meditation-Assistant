	    <li>Disable the "Adaptaptive Brightness" feature on your phone.</li>
	    <li>Adjust the brightness on your phone until you find what is most comfortable for you.</li>
	    <li>Temporarily disable notifications on your phone, so you won't be interrupted during your session.</li>
        <li>Install an app that will keep your screen on. For example, install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.snapcore.screen_alive">Screen Alive App from the Google Play Store.</a> </li>
        <li>Connect your headphones to your smartphone.</li>
        <li>Completely recline in your favorite recliner chair.</li>
        <li>Press the blue start button, which starts both flashing and music on most browsers.</li>
	    <li>Put your smartphone in a "DIY Mind Machine Headset". This custom headset is described below.
            <br>Alternatively, you could simply relax in a dark room and put a phone or tablet close to your face.
            <br>A virtual reality headset can also work, although they are bulky.</li>
        <li> <b> Close your eyes. </b> </li>
        <li>Press anywhere on the screeen to stop the flashing.</li>

           <li> <img src="headsetAdditionalView2p0.png" alt="" class="mainImageFormat"/> </li>
          <li> Find someone who can 3D print these custom parts for the main body and front plates. I use <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/166598975110?itmmeta=01J2J29J7HP0WC9DGQSEX5J3PX&hash=item26ca129e86:g:eJ4AAOSwpVBlzP3H&itmprp=enc%3AAQAJAAAA0DP0jMBHs4EGwu%2B%2B%2BMgcUH%2BYUC%2Bgv%2Bvv0RQgtZi%2BUff%2BmdOUcyv3SFZkyt5aoQexqJYYG3yrpDHugrJ2djsJNQ%2FPtyAZFbbcpQLF9ljEezC0LXS%2FLwNH2an2MF4PweOIb%2FvCKRc%2FW8cVXKAurARQwq1oFoM1KyR64QYg3aJZWMiq4vNGw4QC%2FlsNTkjbrse%2BJfx9%2BN82liP%2FvSBntTCtMS5LYODmzmiqcSkxC4TECGE6QX3hdxXmMdISKvPmJR3wRp9xprDHEwv20OJrXRWCFxY%3D%7Ctkp%3ABk9SR-6jpsKUZA">OCpartsupply</a>.

          <li> Purchase the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B6CLQJCH/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Elastic Bands for Wigs</a>  and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079JW16JC/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1">Foam Face Replacement Face Cover Pad</a> </li>
          <li> Follow the assembly instructions below. </li>

       </ul>
       </li>
       <p> </p>
       <br>
       <li> Option #3 (Buy a custom 3D printed headset from me.)
          <p> </p>
          <ul>
          <li> I'll try to keep a supply of around ten 3D printed headsets and accessory parts that I can mail to anyone who is interested for $50. </li>
          <li> You will still need to assemble the headset by following the instructions below. </li>
          <li> I can only mail these headsets within the USA, and I only accept payments via PayPal.
          <li> Email me if you would like to buy one. Include in your email subject line: "DIY Mind Machine Headset". Be aware that if I'm hiking or fishing, I might be slow at responding. </li>
          <li> My name is Mark. My email address is:  </li>

      <br>
      <li> <b>Assembly Instructions for Custom Headset using 3D Printed Parts: </b>
        <p></p>
        <ul>
          <li> Cut each strap in half. Feed the straps through the slots. Use the front slot for your phone, back slot for your head. </li>
          <li> Secure the two most outer plates with the machine screws and nuts. These screws will hold the phone upright, along with the velcro straps.</li>
          <li> Secure all of the plates to the main body using machine screws and nuts.</li>
          <li> Cut some 3/4" wide velcro strips ("hook" or "prickly" side) so that the velcro fits on the top and bottom rim of the main body. </li>
          <li> Attach the face cover pad to the rim of the main body. The face cover pad will stick to the velcro. </li>
          <li> Adjust the straps if necessary. Trim the excess strap once you are satisfied with the fit. </li>

        </ul>
      </li>
