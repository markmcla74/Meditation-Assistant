     <div id="myParagraph">
        <ul>
	    <li>Disable the "Adaptaptive Brightness" feature on your phone.</li>
	    <li>Adjust the brightness on your phone until you find what is most comfortable for you.</li>
	    <li>Temporarily disable notifications on your phone, so you won't be interrupted during your session.</li>
        <li>Install an app that will keep your screen on. For example, install the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=in.snapcore.screen_alive">Screen Alive App from the Google Play Store.</a> </li>
        <li>Connect your headphones to your smartphone.</li>
        <li>Completely recline in your favorite recliner chair.</li>
        <li>Press the blue start button to begin the flashing.
            <br>TIP: Turn your phone horizontally, then scroll so you see the entire "Start" button.
            <br>This will maximize the flashing part of the screen.</li>
	    <li>Put your smartphone in a "DIY Mind Machine Headset". This custom headset is described below.
            <br>Alternatively, you could simply relax in a dark room and put a phone or tablet close to your face.
            <br>A virtual reality headset can also work, although they are bulky.</li>
        <li> <b> Close your eyes. </b> </li>
        <li>Press anywhere on the screeen to stop the flashing.</li>

          <p> </p>
          <ul>
